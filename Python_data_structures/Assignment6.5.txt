assignment: Write code using find() and string slicing (see section 6.10) to 
extract the number at the end of the line below. Convert the extracted value to
a floating point number and print it out.

text = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475";

#Here starts my code (I run it on ipython - it's python 2.7, course required)

pos0 = text.find('0')

str_num = text[pos0:]

num_float = float(str_num)

print num_float
