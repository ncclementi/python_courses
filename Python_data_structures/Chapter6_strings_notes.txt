* raw_input function in python 2 is renamed as input() in python 3

  Example of how it works:
    >>> name = input('Enter:')
    Enter:naty
    >>> print(name)
    naty

- We can access to each element by isung the index operator []
- strings have length, we access to that information using the built in
  function len()
- We can loop through strings
- We can slice and pull out sub-strings
- The operator '+' for strings is for concatenate, remember it doesn't add spaces.

* Built in function for strings. If we have a string s then:

    - s.lower()   : gives a lower case copy of the string s.
    - s.upper()   : gives a upper case copy of the string s.
    - s.find('c') : it will find the character 'c' in the string and tells me
                    where it finds it. For example:

                 >>> fruit = 'banana'
                 >>> pos   = fruit.find('na')
                 >>> print(pos)
                 2           

                If it doesn't find anythin it'll ruturn -1

    syntax: s.find(str, beg=0, end=len(string))

    - s.replace() : gives a copy with the replacement I applied. For example:

                >>> greet = 'Hello Bob'
                >>> nstr  = greet.replace('o', 'X')
                >>> print(nstr)
                HellX BXb

    - If we want to remove white spaces at the beginning or ending, we use
        
        - s.lstrip(): removes from the left.
        - s.rstrip(): removes from the right.
        - s.strip() : removes from both endings.

    - When we are looking for prefixes, we use startswith function:
        
        >>> line = 'Please have a nice day'    
        >>> line.startswith('Please')
        True
        >>> line.startswith('p') ### Notice is lowercase
        False
        >>> line.startswith('P') 
        True


To know all the things that are built in into a variable, we can use the function
dir()

    >>> dir(s)
    ['capitalize',  'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', ...]
