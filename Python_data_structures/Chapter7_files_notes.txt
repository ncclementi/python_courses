* Opening a File
    
    - We use the built in function open(), returns a handle (mechanism that you
     can use to get the data) to manipulate the file.  
    
        handle = open(filname, mode)

        - filaname is a string
        - mode is optional, should be 'r' if we are planning reading the file
          and 'w' if we are going to write the file. 

        - the act of opening doesn't mean we are reading the data in it. 

* newline character \n

    >>> stuff = 'Hello\nWorld!'
    >>> stuff
    'Hello\nWorld!'
    >>> print stuff
    Hello
    World!   
  
    >>> len(stuff)
    12 #it counts the character '\n' 


* File Handle as a Sequence

    - A 'file handle' open for read can be treated as a sequence of string 
      where each line in the file is a string in the sequence.

    - We can use the 'for' statement to iterate through a sequence.

        xfile = open('mbox.txt')
    
        for line in xfile:
            print line      # this is a way of reading.
   
    - We can count the lines in a file by using a counter and a for loop.

* We can read the whole file (newlines and all), but it's not going to be break
  down into lines. It's a long string.

    - Not recomended for big files, it's not going to fit in primary memory.

* Searching through a file:

    fhand = open('file.txt')
    for line in fhand:
        if line.startswith('From:'):
            print line

    Notes:
     
    - The 'print' adds newline to each line
    - If each line of a file has a newline, we will end with blank lines in 
      between the lines printed. 

    In this case we can use rstrip() to strip the lines before printing them.
    
        - newlines '\n' are whitspaces, so we can strip them.

* We can skip lines by using 'continue'. This is a good patern when you have lot
  of lines

    fhand = open('file.txt')
        for line in fhand:
            line = line.rstrip()
            #Skip 'uninteresting lines'
            if not line.startswith('From:'):
                continue                
            # Process our 'interesting' line
            print line

* We can use 'in' to select lines.

        fhand = open('file.txt')
        for line in fhand:
            line = line.rstrip()

            if not '@uct.ac.za' in line:
                continue                

            print line
